# Week Beginning 13th May 2019
## Monday 13th

* Worked on [CBSE-6603](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBSE-6603) where we are seeing DCP NOOP disconnects on a 4.6.5 cluster
* Updated [MB-33734](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33734) with results showing that performance does not drop with pending to replica change.
* Updated [MB-33943](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33943).

### Actions
* Need to try Docker image for running make test on REHL 8 beta.

## Tuesday 14th

* Worked on [CBSE-6798](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBSE-6798) which is related to  [CBSE-6603](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBSE-6603).  However in this case rebalance failed due to a tcp_error: etimed_out.
* Worked on [CBSE-6727](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBSE-6727) where access scanner is causing a drop in DCP performance.

## Wednesday 15th

* Wrote up solution for [CBSE-6727](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBSE-6727) which was to increase the number of auxIO threads.  See Lessons Learn for comment on how to change setting both statically and dynamically.  Raised MB to fix problem long-term [MB-34190](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34190).  Also Raised Doc MB to fix outdated documentation associated with cbectl [DOC-5238](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/DOC-5238).
* Raised MB for an improvement to how we present task scheduler stats [MB-34192](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34192).
* Identfied the MB that solved the DCP NOOP disconnect issue seen in [CBSE-6603](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBSE-6603)

### Lessons Learnt
* Use *cbectl* for dynamic changes
* Use *diag/eval* for changes to remain after a node is restarted.  e.g.
  to flusher_batch_split_trigger to 3:
```  
curl -i -u Administrator:password --data 'ns_bucket:update_bucket_props("default", [{extra_config_string, "flusher_batch_split_trigger=3"}]).' http://localhost:8091/diag/eval
```

## Thursday 16th

* Meet-up with tools.  Got link to google drive docs etc.
* Worked on patch for updating memory usage of checkpoint.  See [109191](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/109191/).
* Reviewed all of current KV CBSEs.
* Raised MB to document not using proprietary libraries [DOC-5244](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/DOC-5244)
* KV-meeting / tools meeting and Mad-Hatter Status meeting and KV leadership meeting.

### Actions
* Investigate CBSE: TTL issue in XDCR cluster
* Need backport of auditing log rotate fix.

## Friday 17th

* Worked on replicating the snapshot_start where we use an uninitialised value.  Focused on performing experiments using single VB.  Discussed finding with Jim. -see [MB-34173](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34173).  Producing a report of experimental results see [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11c8mLfBdkeEUqmAlkFi7zXLvl41llbBOL5JCQ9-4qec/edit).
* Meet with Scott from the Storage Team discussed compaction requirements.  Magma will trigger compaction asynchronously.  However for tests is required to trigger synchronously through the compactDB interface.  The configuration parameters can be passed through the compactDB interface then saved internally in magma for now.

### Actions
* Arrange meeting with Scott Fridays 5pm for an hour.
* Extend snapshot_start tests and complete report.
