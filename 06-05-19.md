# Week Beginning 6th May 2019
## Monday 6th

* On holiday- bank holiday.

### Action

* Post up result when finished the rerun of Rebalance-out (min), 5 -> 4, 1B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate - see [run 702](http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/titan-reb/702).

## Tuesday 30th

* Regenerated toy-build for [MB-33943](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33943).  Awaiting a re-run of the test.
* Set of rerun of Rebalance DGM test, see [710](http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/titan-reb/710)
* Worked on [MB-32591](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32591).  Fixed patch that estimates amount of memory recovered through expelling - see [108453](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108453/).  Also updated patches asociated with getActiveVBucketsSortedByChkMgrMem and getActiveVBucketsTotalCheckpointMemoryUsage to not filter on Active vbuckets, but instead consider all vbuckets.  Looking at original patches (see Useful links below) there does not seem to be a good reason to only use active.  For example views creates a cursor against replica vbuckets.  The patches are [108672](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108672/) and [108760](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108760/). Also raised a patch to change the name of isCursorDroppingNeeded to isReductionInCheckpointMemoryNeeded - see [108791](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108791/)
* Separated the investigation of using an std:deque for the checkpoint list out of MB-32591 and into a separate MB targetted at Cheshire-Cat and currently marked as an investigation - see [MB-34076](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34076)

* Original cursor dropping MB - [MB-9897](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-9897)
* Original patch for getActiveVBucketsSortedByChkMgrMem - [52132](http://review.couchbase.com/#/c/52132/)
* Orihinal patch for getActiveVBucketsTotalCheckpointMemoryUsage http://review.couchbase.com/#/c/92559/

## Wednesday 8th
* Worked on socket stats patch.  Focused on creating a socket test in platform that allows us to test the unsent send buffer and unread read buffer stats.
* Noticed that the Rebalance-out (min), 5 -> 4, 1B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate last run in Showfast was for Alice and therefore migth explain why we are seeing such a speed-up when using the pending vbucekt patch.  Therefore set-off test on Mad-Hatter build so that can compare.
* Push to get outstanding patches for changes to  getActiveVBucketsSortedByChkMgrMem and getActiveVBucketsTotalCheckpointMemoryUsage into master.

## Thursday 9th
* Spent the day working on [MB-33943](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33943).  An issue with KV rebalance getting stuck when using RHEL 8 beta.
### Actions

* Noticed RedHat 8 was offically released on 7th May.  So need to know if build have been updated. 

## Friday 10th
* Worked on developing tests for patch [108904](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108904/).  Have a couple of test that test expelling occurs before cursor dropping, and if expelling drops the memory sufficiently then will not cursor drop.
