# Week Beginning 15th April 2019
## Monday 15th

* Took over [MB-33773](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33773) from Paolo so he could focus on the sync replication work
* Trond pinged me to see if I knew how connsLock could get deadlocked.  See (MB-336330(https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33633).  Spent the rest of the day trying to find possible causes.  Thought I found a reason but then realised that the setDisconnect is using conn which is a std::shared_ptr<ConnHandler> and so we will call the base method, which just sets the disconnect flag to true.

### Learning Points
* Use ```static_pointer_cast``` to go up class hierarchy and use ```dynamic_pointer_cast``` to go down/across class hierarchy.

### Actions
* Need to reply to the following quested asked by Poonam:
 1. Is HIFI-MFU the new eviction policy, you mentioned, that was introduced in 5.5? - DONE
 2. Can you please explain how HIFI-MFU treats vBuckets in different states â€“ active, pending and replica? - DONE

## Tuesday 16th
* Spent most of the day working on [MB-33773](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33773).  Identified the toot cause and replicated in a simple c++ program.
* Replied back to Poonam on the hash table eviction questions.
* Investigated [CBSE-6629](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBSE-6629).  It appears to be a duplcate of [MB-30017)(https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30017).  This requires further investigaton.
* Changed [MB-33773](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33773) status from "Fixed" to "Cannot reproduce"

### Actions
* My two patches [107546](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/107546/) and 
[107713](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/107713/) have been reviewed and need to be updated.
* Need to continue investigation of CBSE-6629.
