# Week Beginning 1st April 2019
## Monday 1st
* Completed patch to increase debugging for [MB-33423](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33423). see [http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/106703](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/106703/)
* Worked on [MB-33253](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33253) appears to be a problem with when we flush a bucket.  Where EP ns_server calls a series of delete vbuckets followed by a series of create vbuckets. The DCP connections seem to remain intact and we do not clean-up the number of active/snoozing backfills correctly.

## Tuesday 2nd
* Contined work on [MB-33253](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33253).  After talking with Jim understand the behaviour to be that we want to close all streams on a flush however the dcp connections can remain.  Worked on duplicating the issue with a exp_store_test that does the following:

``` 
1. Creates some items
2. Creates a new checkpoint
3. Create more items
4. Create another checkpoint - (now can remove initial checkpoint)
5. Remove closed unreferenced checkpoints
   (will result in producer requiring a backfill)
6. Create a DCP producer
7. Do a streamRequest of the producer to produce a stream.
   (This will result in the backfill being generated.)
8. Delete the vbucket
9. Re-create the vbucket - step 8 and 9 replicates what happens on a flush.
10. Repeat steps 1 to 5 so that another backfill will be required.
11. Repeat step 7.
```

## Wednesday 3rd
* Contined work on [MB-33253](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33253).  Got test working, however it looks like although we end-up running backfills for dead stream, they do complete in the end.  So I still don't understand why we are seeing the issue reported.  Therefore worked on trying to reproduce the test.  Had issue:
```
godeps/src/github.com/andelf/go-curl/easy.go:408:22: identifier
"_Ctype_struct_curl_slist" may conflict with identifiers generated by    cgo
```
Ben Brooks told me that he thought was a `vet` tool warning (newer versions of Go won't compile when there are vet warnings). And that he tought GSI used go 1.7.6. and that different version of go can be downloaded from [here](https://golang.org/doc/install#extra_versions)

* Worked on [CBSE-6603](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBSE-6603) where we are seeing rebalance failures with no_stats_for_this_vbucket.  The failures are due to connections being disconnected due to NOOP timeouts.  Also seeing very slow GET_REPLICA calls (some taking over one hour!).  There appears to be slow storage with slow FlusherTask times, but what confused me is that the test show it is 100% resident.  I think it may be due to backfill that is occuring during backfill.  The reason for this is the slow GET_REPLICA calls are only seen in batches of time and not all the time.  Need to investigate further.
