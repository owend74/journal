* Addressed comments on patch [107546](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/107546/).
* Raised [MB-33906](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33906) which is a 6.0.2 backport for the GET_REPLICA bug.  Also created corresponding patch - see [108159](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108159/)
* Worked on [MB-32576](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32576) and completed the associated patch - see [108164](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108164/).

## Wednesday 24th
* Investigated a potential reoccurrance of the delete bucket deadlock from [MB-33633](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33633).  Unfortunately did not appear to be in deadlock.
* Worked on [MB-32592](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32592) getting the ioctl stats for the amount of data left in the send buffer and the amount left in the receive buffer.
* Closed [MB-32576](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32576) as the associated patch got merged - see [108164](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108164/)

## Thursday 25th
* Worked on cursor dropping trigger bug [MB-33918](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33918).  Targetting for Alice
* Raised MB for rebalance sizing requirement - see [MB-33931](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33931).  After discussion with Shivani it is being moved to Cheshire-cat.
* Closed [MB-33906](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33906) as the associated patch got merged - see [108159](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108159/)
* Create duplicate patch for testing ns_server going pending only during the takeover phase - see [108254](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108254/). From which created a toy [build](http://server.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/toy-unix/4805/).  Started to runn DGM rebalance tests.  First result is in:

| Rebalance Test | Original Performance | Pending Patch Performance |
| ---------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
|Rebalance-in (min), 4 -> 5, 1B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate | 37.2 | 36.3 |
|Rebalance-swap (min), 4 -> 4, 1B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate | 59.5 | 52.5 |
|Rebalance-out (min), 5 -> 4, 1B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate | 34.8 | 36.9 |
|Rebalance-swap (min), 9 -> 9, 1B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate | 25.4 | 25.5 |
|Rebalance-swap (min), 9 -> 9, 10B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate | 496 | ??? |

### Learning Point

* Robust Rebalance [PRD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wkwWlsufAl5LcurXPhODQeajhjizbpnBzlLpHQRgeb8/edit?ts=5a061912#heading=h.7f3ejgd0lbpo)

## Friday 26th
* Collected more sata for the ns_server pending patch (see table above)
* Used folly::Synchronize to remove an explict lock from Checkpoint - see  patch [108328](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108328/)
* Performance tested with expelling turned on (see patch [108320](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108320/). Looks like do not lose any performance, however after discussion with Dave we agreed to reduce to be applied when we trigger cursor dropping (we will try expelling first for each vbucket, then if we need more memory apply cursor dropping).
* Worked on [MB-33918](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33918) which aims to fix the cursor triggering.  Is broken into two patches - first is a formatting and logging patch [108280](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108280/), second is the actual fix [108266](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108266/).
* Got the expel bug where have item after mutation with same seqno into master - see [107546](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/107546/).
* Started to look at the queueLock in CheckpointManager, which is basically one big lock around CheckpointManager - and seeing if we can break into more fine graine locks.

### Actions
* Raise patch for triggering expelling when we normally do cursor dropping.
* Finish [MB-32592](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32592) which uses the ioctl and getsocketopts to get send and receive buffer stats.
