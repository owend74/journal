# Week Beginning 29th April 2019
## Monday 29th

* Worked on [MB-33918](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33918) - two separate patches.  The log messages went into alice last week.  The actual fix to checkpoint triggering is in patch [108266](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108266/).  Got it into master
* Raised [MB-33957](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33957) which is a backport to a fix to cursor dropping tests which were failing for ephemeral buckets, due to the item pager trigger causing items to be deleted which were unexpected.  The patch [108396](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108396/) was raised and went into alice.
* Updated [MB-33734](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33734) with results from running the rebalance tests.  Conclusion was that no real difference therefore should go ahead with making the change.
* Worked on the checkpoint lock prototype.

### Action

* Post up result when finished the rerun of Rebalance-out (min), 5 -> 4, 1B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate - see [run 702](http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/titan-reb/702).

## Tuesday 30th

* Learnt how to merge from an earlier branch into master.  Did so for a commit from alice to master - see [108432](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108432/-1..2)
* Created a page off the KV-Engine intranet paging explaining how to merge - see [Merging+HowTo](https://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/cbeng/Merging+HowTo)
* Started to think about how to integrate the application of expelling with the cursor dropping functionality.  We need to calculate the amount of memory freed during the expelling of items from checkpoints - as we will expel from each vbucket until we clear the amount of memory necessary.  Began development on patch that calculates the memory freed during expelling - see patch [108453](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108453/).
* Tried re-run of Rebalance-out (min), 5 -> 4, 1B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate - but failing because toy-build is no longer available.

### Learning Point
* KV-Engine page on intranet - [see] (https://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/cbeng/KV-Engine)

### Action
* Create new toy build of ns_server pending vbucket change so that can re-run test. - DONE

## Wednesday 1st May
* Out in the morning
* Worked on merging another on of my cursor dropping patches into master - see [108518](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108518/-1..1)
* Updated the Merging Howto intranet page to explain how to CLion can be used to resolve conflicts.
* Created new toy build of ns_server pending vbucket change.

### Action
* Run new toy build on re-run of Rebalance-out (min), 5 -> 4, 1B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate. - DONE

## Thursday 2nd
* Discussed with Dave about how to deal with dummy item in checkpoint expelling.  He suggested that I swap the queued_item pointed to by the cursor with the dummy.  This was a great idea so implemented - see patch [108581](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108581/)
* Merged another BP from Alice to master -so no actual code change.
* Finally got result for rerun of rebalance test with pending vb state (performance was 31.2).  Therefore updated patch for ns_server and assigned reviewers - see [108254](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108254/)
* Worked on patch that calculates the memory freed during expelling - see [108453](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108453/).

### Action
* Jim posted a toy-simple build need to link that and toy-build of the kv-engine internet page
* Coding patch plan:
 1. Swap dummy
 2. memory account
 3. use cursor dropping trigger to expel first
 4. enable expelling
 5. disable backfill queue

 ## Friday 3rd
 * Worked on [MB-33943](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33943). Appears to have deadlock somewhere in setVbucketState and so created a toy build to run the test against - which requires Rehad 8 beta.
 * Continued to work on patch [108453](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108453/) for estimating the amount of memory recovered from expelling.
 * Updated [MB-33734](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33734) with cbmonitor links comparing the data collected with the pending vbucket run with standard run.  Noticed last test shows a big difference in performance and so suggesting created a toy build [4864](http://server.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/toy-unix/4864/) and need to run test again.
 * Developed patch [108672](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108672/) to change the function which gets vbucekts sorted by checkpoint meory usage to be able to take a parameter on the type of vbucket.

### Action
* Once toy-build created (again for pending vbucket change) run the last again.
