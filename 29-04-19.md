# Week Beginning 29th April 2019
## Monday 29th

* Worked on [MB-33918](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33918) - two separate patches.  The log messages went into alice last week.  The actual fix to checkpoint triggering is in patch [108266](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108266/).  Got it into master
* Raised [MB-33957](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33957) which is a backport to a fix to cursor dropping tests which were failing for ephemeral buckets, due to the item pager trigger causing items to be deleted which were unexpected.  The patch [108396](http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108396/) was raised and went into alice.
* Updated [MB-33734](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33734) with results from running the rebalance tests.  Conclusion was that no real difference therefore should go ahead with making the change.
* Worked on the checkpoint lock prototype.

### Action

* Post up result when finished the rerun of Rebalance-out (min), 5 -> 4, 1B x 1KB, 15K ops/sec (90/10 R/W), 10% cache miss rate - see [run 702](http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/titan-reb/702).
